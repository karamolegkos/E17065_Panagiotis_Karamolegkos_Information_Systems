# E17065_Panagiotis_Karamolegkos_Information_Systems
This is my first exercise uploaded at my github. It is based on a subject at my university.

The exercise needed me to code a .py file to be able to start with a list and a dictionary. Then it needed me to make functions that are described below:
--> removeDuplicates(list): Given a list, it will delete the duplicated values of the list and it will live only the first of the duplicated values.
--> removeDictDuplicates(dict): Given a dictionary, it will delete the duplicated values of the list and it will live only the first of the duplicated values.
--> sortList(list): Given a list, it will sort the list.
--> sortDict(dict): Given a dictionary, it will sort the dictionary.
